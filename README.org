#+TITLE: A flat virtual file system
My first ever go at implementing file system structures.
** Resouces
- [[https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/file-implementation.pdf][ File System Implementation]] has been nothing but phenomenal and inspiring to dive deep into file system and enhance my knowledge on low level concepts
  I was not aware of when It comes to data storage and indexing in your typical hard drive.
** Instructions
The project uses vanilla [[https://command-not-found.com/make][make]] to build.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  make
  ./out
#+END_SRC
